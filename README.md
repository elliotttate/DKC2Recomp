# DKC2Recomp

Static recompilation of *Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest* for SNES
into native desktop applications, using the `snesrecomp` framework. Windows
is the currently accepted release platform; an SDL2 gameplay host now provides
the source foundation for Linux and macOS acceptance.

The 65816 game program is translated to native C where analysis can prove an
exact entry state. The current profile compiles every demanded exact CPU-mode
variant; the shared 65816 interpreter remains available as a correctness and
exceptional-path fallback. SNES hardware outside the main CPU—the PPU,
SPC700/S-DSP, DMA/HDMA, controllers, and cartridge mapping—is modeled by the
shared runtime.

## Quick start

1. Download `DKC2Recomp-windows-x64-v0.0.1.zip` from
   [Releases](../../releases) and extract the complete archive.
2. Run `DKC2Recomp.exe`.
3. In the Dear ImGui launcher, select your own legally obtained North American
   v1.0 ROM and choose **Play**.

The selected external path is remembered in `rom.cfg` beside the executable.
The ROM is never copied into the release. Saves are written to
`saves/save.srm`, with the previous clean save retained as `save.srm.bak`.

## Supported ROM

The launcher and runtime verify the ROM after removing an optional 512-byte
copier header.

| Property | Expected value |
| --- | --- |
| Size | 4,194,304 bytes (headerless body) |
| CRC32 | `006364DB` |
| SHA-256 | `35421a9af9dd011b40b91f792192af9f99c93201d8d394026bdfb42cbf2d8633` |
| Internal name | `DIDDY'S KONG QUEST` |
| Region/version | North America v1.0 |

You must supply your own lawfully obtained dump. ROMs, extracted in-game
graphics, music, level data, save files, and generated ROM-derived C are not
distributed in this repository or its release archives. The launcher includes
North American retail cover art solely to identify the supported game and
region; its source and copyright notice are documented in
`recomp/launcher/README.md`.

## Controls

| SNES control | Keyboard |
| --- | --- |
| D-Pad | Arrow keys |
| A | X |
| B | Z |
| X | S |
| Y | A |
| L | Q |
| R | W |
| Start | Enter |
| Select | Shift |
| Rewind | Hold 1 |
| Fast-forward | Hold 2 |
| Save state (slot 0) | F5 |
| Load state (slot 0) | F9 |
| Toggle performance log | F |
| Quit | Escape |

The launcher exposes independent Player 1 and Player 2 source selectors. By
default the keyboard controls Player 1 and the first connected gamepad controls
Player 2. The accepted Windows host uses XInput; the portable host uses SDL
GameController. Players set to Gamepad receive connected devices in player
order, so two gamepads drive the two SNES controller ports independently.
Source and deadzone choices persist in `launcher.cfg`. The left trigger rewinds
and the right trigger fast-forwards on an assigned gamepad.

The Settings page has a fixed **Restore Defaults** button. After confirmation,
it restores the complete DKC2 launcher configuration: window/display choices,
audio, controller sources and deadzones, and the skip-launcher preference.
The selected ROM, cartridge SRAM, save states, and rewind history are not
deleted or replaced. The restored choices are persisted when Play is pressed.

## Video settings

The launcher defaults to the OpenGL presenter with nearest-neighbor sampling
and the **Raw** screen model. Raw is a byte-exact presentation bypass. The
opt-in **CRT**, **Composite**, and **Trinitron** choices apply the present-time
screen-color lookup table used by PSXRecomp: CRT models a consumer SMPTE-C-like
phosphor gamut, display gamma, luminance, and black floor; the other two retain
the corresponding upstream variants. This model changes color response only;
it does not add scanlines, curvature, a bezel, or persistence blur.

The **GDI compatibility** renderer remains selectable and is also used
automatically if OpenGL initialization fails. Screen-color selection is
renderer-independent, so CRT produces the same transformed source pixels on
both presentation paths. **Nearest/Bilinear** controls only how that completed
frame is scaled. Settings persist in `launcher.cfg`; Raw remains the default
unless the user opts in. For repeatable diagnostics, `DKC2_SCREEN=raw`, `crt`,
`composite`, or `trinitron` overrides the saved screen model for one process.

Save states are stored beside the executable as `saves/dkc2s0.sav`. Slot 0
still loads the former `saves/dkc20.sav` name as a compatibility fallback, but
all new writes use the unambiguous name. States are separate from the
cartridge SRAM files used for normal in-game saves.

The game window title reports the measured presentation rate once per second.
Press `F` to write per-phase main-thread timings to `performance.log` beside
the executable; press it again to stop. The log identifies the active OpenGL
or GDI backend and selected screen model. It measures CPU time spent submitting
presentation work, but neither path currently collects GPU timestamp queries,
so GPU time remains explicitly unavailable instead of being reported as zero.

## Crash reports and support bundles

Both playable hosts maintain `diagnostics/last_run_report.json` beside the
executable. A runtime failure or native Windows exception also creates a
timestamped `diagnostics/diagnostic_bundle_*` folder; Windows exception bundles
contain a minidump. Set `DKC2_DIAGNOSTIC_BUNDLE=1` before one launch to request
the same support folder after a clean exit.

Bundles use a strict allowlist: the JSON report, instructions, an optional
`launcher.cfg`, an optional `performance.log`, and an optional Windows
minidump. They never copy `rom.cfg`, ROM bytes or paths, generated game code,
SRAM, save states, screenshots, or audio captures. Loaded program-module paths
and basic operating-system/hardware information are included, so inspect the
folder before sharing it. See
[`docs/DESKTOP_TESTING.md`](docs/DESKTOP_TESTING.md) for the crash drills and
platform behavior. Mod-aware save isolation remains deferred until a real mod
manifest and loader exist; current save locations are otherwise unchanged.

## First-level route testing

Pirate Panic is the next gameplay correctness target. The desktop host can
record per-frame input with `SNESRECOMP_INPUT_REC`, and the headless host can
replay it with `SNESRECOMP_INPUT_PLAY`. The new private route gate checks that
the replay enters Pirate Panic, stays active, changes the completion flags,
triggers a level-exit transition, and keeps audio unclipped.

Recordings should live in ignored private storage such as `recordings/` or
`private/`. See
[`docs/FIRST_LEVEL_ROUTE_TESTING.md`](docs/FIRST_LEVEL_ROUTE_TESTING.md) for
the exact recording and replay commands. The first captured route reaches the
goal, but the native replay currently exposes an unresolved dispatch at
`$BA:B33F`; Roadmap #2 remains open until that path replays without an
interpreter-cap or unresolved-dispatch diagnostic.

## Static recompilation coverage

The current sound analysis profile emits all 3,468 demanded exact CPU-mode
variants as static C (100%). This is a compile-time structural count, not a
percentage of dynamically executed CPU instructions and not a claim that the
shared interpreter can be removed.

The interpreter remains the safe runtime default for an unavailable exact
entry state. Two dormant bugs in the original game also deliberately preserve
their real JSR stack frames and hand control to the interpreter if reached:
both calls enter bytes documented as data/garbage and crash on original
hardware. They are explicit exceptional edges from compiled callers, not
LLE-only code variants and not guessed native implementations.

The generated C remains ignored because it is derived from the user's ROM.
Only source-owned configuration and structural metadata are committed.

## Building from source

Prerequisites on Windows:

- CMake and Ninja;
- a C/C++ toolchain (MSVC or MinGW-w64; an installed SDL2 package is optional);
- Python 3.9+; and
- Rust/Cargo for the native whole-program analyzer.

```powershell
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/mstan/DKC2Recomp
cd DKC2Recomp

.\scripts\generate_snesrecomp.ps1 -Rom "C:\private\dkc2.sfc"

$env:Path = "C:\msys64\mingw64\bin;$env:Path"
cmake -S . -B build-release -G Ninja `
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release `
  -DDKC2_BUILD_SNESRECOMP=ON `
  -DSDL2_DIR=C:\msys64\mingw64\lib\cmake\SDL2
cmake --build build-release --target dkc2_snesrecomp_desktop
```

The build can fetch the pinned SDL 2.30.9 source when an installed SDL2 package
is unavailable, so `SDL2_DIR` is optional. Windows also builds the portable
host as `DKC2RecompSDL.exe` with target `dkc2_snesrecomp_sdl`.

Linux and macOS use the portable generator and SDL gameplay target:

```sh
python3 scripts/generate_snesrecomp.py --rom /private/path/dkc2.sfc
cmake -S . -B build-release -G Ninja \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DDKC2_BUILD_SNESRECOMP=ON
cmake --build build-release --target dkc2_snesrecomp_sdl
./build-release/DKC2Recomp /private/path/dkc2.sfc
```

The SDL host is runtime-tested on Windows. Linux and macOS are not called
supported releases until their native acceptance matrices pass. See
[`docs/CROSS_PLATFORM.md`](docs/CROSS_PLATFORM.md) for prerequisites, exact
commands, implemented features, and the remaining platform gates.

Project-owned desktop and headless code is compiled for speed in Release
builds (`-O3` with GCC/Clang and `/O2`, MSVC's maximum speed preset, with
MSVC). To embed a private Windows `.ico` without adding it to Git, configure
with `-DDKC2_DESKTOP_ICON="C:\private\dkc2.ico"`.

Create the next source-clean, user-testable Windows snapshot with:

```powershell
.\scripts\create_windows_version.ps1
```

The first run creates `versions\Version 01`, the next creates
`versions\Version 02`, and so on. Existing numbered folders are never deleted
or overwritten. Each folder contains both playable Windows hosts, the required
launcher assets, documentation, and a `VERSION.txt` provenance/hash manifest.
Normal packaging refuses uncommitted source; `-AllowDirty` is available only
for an explicitly marked development snapshot.
The packager allowlists the documented launcher cover and refuses ROM, save,
generated, diagnostic, configuration, screenshot, and audio artifacts. The
compiler continues to reuse its normal build tree; only testable handoffs are
duplicated, avoiding multi-gigabyte source/build copies.

Use `build-snesrecomp/` as the single routine Windows compiler workspace and
launch manual-test builds only from `versions/Version NN/`. The older
`build*` folders are explained and classified in
[`docs/BUILD_HYGIENE.md`](docs/BUILD_HYGIENE.md); they are not additional source
versions.
